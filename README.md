# hk-mtr-fare-modeling
A machine learning project done in Python with the topic of Hong Kong MTR's fares. The model's main objectives were to answer:
1. What factors affect the pricing of MTR fares in Hong Kong?
2. How many routes in a district are unreasonably expensive in real life compared to the model's predictions?

The code is a Jupyter notebook file and can be run immediately once all the other neccesary files are downloaded.
